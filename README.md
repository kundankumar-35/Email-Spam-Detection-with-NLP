🛠️ Project Steps

<details>
<summary>🔹 1. Data Loading</summary>  📂 Load email data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 2. Text Cleaning 🧹</summary>  🔤 Convert all text to lowercase.

❌ Remove punctuation, special characters, and extra whitespace.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 3. Tokenization & Stop Word Removal ✂️</summary>  ✨ Tokenize email text into individual words.

🚫 Remove common English stop words using NLTK.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 4. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF) 📊</summary>  🔡 Convert processed text into numerical features using TF-IDF.

📈 Create a sparse matrix where:

Rows → emails

Columns → words

Values → importance of words in an email relative to the entire dataset



</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 5. Data Splitting ✂️</summary>  ✍️ Split dataset into Training and Testing sets.

🎯 Ensure evaluation is performed on unseen data.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 6. Model Training 🤖</summary>  Trained three different models:

🔹 Logistic Regression → strong baseline linear model.

🌳 Decision Tree Classifier → interpretable tree-based model.

🌲 Random Forest Classifier → ensemble of decision trees for higher accuracy.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 7. Prediction 🔮</summary>  Use trained models to predict whether emails are spam or not spam.


</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 8. Model Evaluation 📏</summary>  Metrics used:

✅ Accuracy

✅ Precision

✅ Recall

✅ F1-score


👉 Special attention to Recall since minimizing false negatives is crucial in spam detection.

</details>  <details>
<summary>🔹 9. Model Comparison ⚔️</summary>  Compared the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Identified the best-performing model for the dataset.

Discussed trade-offs (e.g., choosing recall over accuracy).

📊 Results & Model Comparison

The evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) are printed for all three models.

Best-performing model is selected based on dataset analysis.

Trade-offs between false positives and false negatives are discussed.

✅ Conclusion

This project showcases a complete ML pipeline for spam detection.

Highlights the strengths of different classifiers on TF-IDF vectorized text data.

Demonstrates the importance of Recall in spam detection (catching spam emails is more important than mistakenly classifying a valid email as spam).

✨ This project is a strong baseline for email spam detection and can be extended with deep learning models like LSTMs or Transformers for more advanced performance.Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification, often a strong baseline.
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that makes decisions based on features.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Prediction: Uses the trained models to predict the labels (spam or not spam) for the emails in the testing set.
Model Evaluation: Calculates key evaluation metrics for each model's predictions against the actual labels, including:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Comparison: Compares the performance of the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models based on the calculated metrics to identify the best-performing model for this dataset and problem.
Usage
To run the project:

Ensure you have followed the setup steps.
Execute the Python script or run the code cells in a Jupyter Notebook/Colab environment sequentially. The code will perform data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
Results and Model Comparison
The project evaluates the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. The evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) for each model are printed to the console, allowing for a direct comparison.

Based on the analysis of these metrics, the best-performing model for this specific dataset and task is identified and reported. Considerations for choosing the best model, such as the importance of minimizing false negatives (high Recall) in spam detection, are also discussed.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a standard pipeline for building an email spam detection system using NLP and machine learning. The results highlight the effectiveness of different classification algorithms on a TF-IDF vectorized text dataset.
