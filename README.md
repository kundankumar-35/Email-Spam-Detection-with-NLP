Project Steps
The project follows these main steps:

Data Loading: Loads the email data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Text Cleaning: Preprocesses the email text by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, special characters, and extra whitespace.
Tokenization and Stop Word Removal: Breaks down the cleaned text into tokens and removes common English stop words using NLTK.
Feature Extraction (TF-IDF): Converts the processed text into numerical features using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method from scikit-learn. This creates a matrix where each row represents an email and each column represents a word, with values indicating the importance of the word in that email relative to the corpus.
Data Splitting: Splits the TF-IDF matrix and the corresponding labels into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Model Training: Trains three different classification models on the training data:
Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification, often a strong baseline.
Decision Tree Classifier: A tree-based model that makes decisions based on features.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Prediction: Uses the trained models to predict the labels (spam or not spam) for the emails in the testing set.
Model Evaluation: Calculates key evaluation metrics for each model's predictions against the actual labels, including:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Comparison: Compares the performance of the Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models based on the calculated metrics to identify the best-performing model for this dataset and problem.
Usage
To run the project:

Ensure you have followed the setup steps.
Execute the Python script or run the code cells in a Jupyter Notebook/Colab environment sequentially. The code will perform data loading, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, prediction, and evaluation.
Results and Model Comparison
The project evaluates the performance of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. The evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) for each model are printed to the console, allowing for a direct comparison.

Based on the analysis of these metrics, the best-performing model for this specific dataset and task is identified and reported. Considerations for choosing the best model, such as the importance of minimizing false negatives (high Recall) in spam detection, are also discussed.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a standard pipeline for building an email spam detection system using NLP and machine learning. The results highlight the effectiveness of different classification algorithms on a TF-IDF vectorized text dataset.
